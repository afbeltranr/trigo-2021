Hi Andres!<br /><br />How are you? How was your summer holiday? We all kept somewhat busy tutoring, which was nice. :)<br /><br />Overall, your sessions looked and sounded good. Tone was friendly and encouraging. Content was accurate and pacing was good. You tried to engage the students with leading questions, when they were unsure. This is a good way to avoid answer giving.&nbsp;I liked the way you handled the younger student who wanted to play tic tac to after asking you a question.&nbsp; You kept it professional. Keep up the enthusiasm and effort! :)<br /><br />As always, feel free to contact me via email with questions, comments or concerns.<br /><br />Have a wonderful weekend and take care!<br /><br />Gretchen<br /><br />GCarter@mentors.tutor.com
