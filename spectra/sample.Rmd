```{r gg-oz-plot, fig.cap = "Life expectancy from 1952 - 2007 for Australia. Life expentancy increases steadily except from 1962 to 1969. We can safely say that our life expectancy is higher than it has ever been!"}

x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x,y)
```

Australia's life expectancy has increased a great deal over the past 50 years
